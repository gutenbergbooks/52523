  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Cheiromancy, the art of foretelling the events
of life by the lineaments of the hand, derived its
name from the Greek word <em>cheiros</em>, the palm, and
<em>manteia</em>, to foretell, whence it has been vulgarly
called Palmistry—as it is named in a recent Act
of Parliament to forbid its practice for gain or
reward. In Coleman's <cite>Mythology of the Hindoos</cite>,
p. 202, it is written: "On the Buddha's foot is the
mark called the 'chakravarti,' wheel or discus,
which should have been on the palm of the hand,
by which the sages at his birth divined that he
would rise to considerable eminence." He says
(p. 19): "Various data have been assigned to the
period of Buddha's existence. The most correct
seems to be about 550 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, whence, as the sages
practised cheiromancy at Buddha's birth, its existence
must have been much earlier known among
the Indians." "In the year 1652," writes Zadkiel,
"the celebrated astrologer, Geo. Wharton, Esq.,
published a translation of 'a matchless piece' as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>he terms it, on the subject, written in Latin by
Dr. J. Rothman." Since that period the art of
cheiromancy has gradually fallen into disuse,
chiefly from the extensive nonsense published by
recent writers. One of the writers makes a
shallow attempt to disprove the connection which
exists between astrology and palmistry, while
another says it is based on the principles of the
Kabalah, the latter being nothing more than
a mnemonical system of astrology. From the
writings of Dr. J. Rothman and Geo. Wharton,
Esq., I propose now to give, together with some
of the choicest of those of the East, the principal
matter, and to explain in the ordinary language
used by palmisters such points as may require
elucidation. Mr. Wharton, a careful student in
these subjects, clearly proves that palmistry can
only act in accordance with astrology, and that the
art of cheiromancy cannot be relied upon beyond
the period of from one to two years at most, for he
observes in his preface, "What more convincing
than if, by inspection made into the hand of any
man, I truly pronounce this or that planet essentially
dignified or angular in his geniture, or in
such or such a position with other planets or stars,
another unfortunate, afflicted or defected? Or if,
on the contrary, by looking first into the geniture
and considering therein the several positions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>the planets and their configurations one to another
and with other stars, I tell him, and that distinctly
and truly, the lines and signatures engraven upon
his head or hand—what, I say, is or can be more
satisfactory than this to rational men, as touching
the power and influence of the planets and stars
upon these inferiors, and consequently of the
lawful use and truth of the science called astrology,
cheiromancy and metoposcopia, between which
three sciences there appear to be such a secret
coherence and harmony?"</p>

<p class='c000'>It is also written in the <em>Book of Job</em>, xxxvii. 7:
"In the hand of all men he shall put a mark that
everyone may know his own work"; but in our
translation of the <cite>Bible</cite> it is written as follows:
"In the hand of all men he putteth a mark that
every man may know his own work." This alone
proves that Job believed in this science.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author does not claim that there is anything
new in this work, although the method of
translating and setting may be original.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>A Summary of Judgment.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>(1) Observe the kind of hands from the front or
inside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Short hands denote an impulsive judgment without
analysis.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Smooth hands denote impression, ability, inspiration,
intuition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hard, firm hands denote great energy and perseverance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soft, loose hands denote a kind of debility or
laziness, a disinclination to work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knotted hands denote reflection, order, success.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) Observe the fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pointed.</em>—Forefinger (first), intuitive; middle
finger (second), frivolous, light-hearted, gay; ring
finger (third), artistic, testy, nice, refined; little
finger (fourth), eloquent.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Square.</em>—Forefinger (first), truthful, cautious;
middle finger (second), grave, thoughtful; ring
finger (third), reasonable, a thinker; little finger
(fourth), judicious.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Spatulated.</em>—Forefinger (first), mystic, delighting
in occult studies; middle finger (second), morbid,
fanciful; ring finger (third), dramatic, sympathetic;
little finger (fourth), mechanical.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) Look at the nails on the hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>1.—Narrow, indicate an irritable temper or aspiring
spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>2.—Round and full, indicate learning and liberal
views.</p>

<p class='c000'>3.—Small, indicate pride, stubbornness, narrowness
and bigotry.</p>

<p class='c000'>4.—Broad and flat, indicate a mild and timorous
disposition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>5.—Filbert-shaped, indicate refinement and courteous
manners.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em>—When the hand is allowed to open freely,
the space between the first and second fingers,
farthest apart, denotes independence of thought;
third and fourth, independence of action, and if
both are very wide apart, originality and self-reliance.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the thumb inclines inward, avarice; outward,
generosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) Observe the length and depth of the lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The quality, whether they are crooked or
straight.</p>

<p class='c000'>(6) Observe whether they touch or cut other lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>(7) Observe whether they are touched or cut by
other lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>(8) Their place and position.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em>—The lines are sometimes lengthened until
certain years of our life, while others are shortened.
At one time they may become pale, at
another they become notably clear and red. The
minor marks, such as are found on the mounts,
sometimes quite vanish, and at other times they will
assume different shapes and colours. Therefore
the most studious in palmistry cannot attain a
complete knowledge of the events of a life at
once, because they come and go as nature, or
the circumstances of life, change and twist, but
can only read for a year or so in advance. These
changes are caused, as before stated, by the progressions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and changing of the laws relating to
nature, of which we are a part.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Hand to Examine.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>The general rule in the East is that the right
palm of the male and the left palm of the female
ought to be examined. In either case take the
hand in which the signs and lines are clearly
shown. If they concur in both hands and appear
clear and nicely marked they declare a constancy
of fortune and health, etc. In the male generally
the right hand is the fate hand or the positive
hand, that is, events about to happen; while the
left denotes the negative or those events which
have come to pass or been accomplished by the
person, or those just passing away. Judge the
converse in the female hands.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Signification of Animals, Flowers and Promiscuous Marks found on the Hand.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>These are principally formed by the smaller lines
running with the pores of the skin. Great care
must therefore be taken in determining these forms,
because very much depends on their position.
The numbers herein referred to have reference to
Plate II of the hand which I have set apart for
the express purpose of showing these marks and
signs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first space of the hand near to the mounts
is that part which has principally to show the
animal passions—lusts and intrigues.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<p>PLATE II.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The second space, or the part of the hand
between the girdle of Venus and the Table line,
deals more specifically with love affairs or the spiritual
side, while the former treats more on the physical
plane.</p>

<p class='c000'>These two, therefore, taken together, may be considered
the moral region of the hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next space between the Table line and the
Liver line may be called the mental and social
region.</p>

<p class='c000'>The one following this may be called the commercial
region or the wealth generally of the person.</p>

<p class='c000'>That space enclosed by the line of Life is the
artistic or dramatic region.</p>

<p class='c000'>The right hand side of the hand separated by the
line of Saturn denotes the positive nature, while
the left hand portion is the negative or imaginative
nature of the individual.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a fish or a similar figure be found at the root
of the hand (No. 1) it signifies great success in the
world—riches and many children.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a lotus flower or like-shaped figure be here,
the person, if a female, will be sure to become a
great lady, in fact almost a queen. If the same be
on a male hand he will be sure to be renowned and
great (No. 2).</p>

<p class='c000'>A serpent found here or on the wrist just above
the Bracelet and near to the line of Saturn, the
man will become a great warrior or hero (Nos. 1
and 3).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>An octagonal figure placed between the line of
Life and the Liver line will cause the person to be
burdened with the possession of landed estates
(No. 4).</p>

<p class='c000'>If conch, or marine shells, or any circular figure
be found here (No. 5) they presage that the person
will be a learned man, especially if they should be
found on the first phalanx of the little finger (No.
6), on the mount of Mercury (No. 7), or on the
mount of the Moon (No. 8).</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the sign of a flag be found here, and particularly
on the mount of Mercury (No. 7) or on
the palm of the hand (No. 9), the person will be a
philosopher and a great thinker.</p>

<p class='c000'>A trident (No. 10), the three-pronged sceptre of
Neptune or similar figure, the person rises to great
fame, almost a prince or princess. If the trident
be formed, but somewhat indistinct, he will not
rise so high, but sure to have very important appointments
and be attached to royalty. He will
also be very kind, generous, and likely to acquire
fame.</p>

<p class='c000'>If in the male hand, or even on the female hand,
there be anything like a spear or bow and arrow
the person is sure to get a throne (No. 11); and if
all three, bow, arrow and lance together be there,
the person is sure to be a king or queen (No. 12).</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the sign of a wheel and flag come together
on the same hand the person will have riches and
power, respect among his fellow-men, will be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>great ruler or prime minister, and be noted or celebrated
for his wisdom and goodness (No. 13).</p>

<p class='c000'>If the sign of an elephant, which of itself is
good (No. 14), or the sign of an earring (No. 15)
and wheel (No. 16) appear on the same hand
together, the person is likely to be an emperor or
great personage.</p>

<p class='c000'>A hill (No. 17) or wristlet (No. 18) like a bough
or something like the head of a man (No. 19), or a
pitcher (No. 20), the person is almost sure to rise to
the exalted position of a minister of state.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the sign of a barleycorn be found on the flat
part of the thumb the person will spend life very
happily and go through life easily (No. 21). Should
the barley appear on the mount of Mars, in the
centre of the hand, the person will be very intellectual,
respectable and wise (No. 22). Should the
form of the barley be found under any two fingers,
especially on the mount of Saturn, the possessor
will lead a happy life, honourable, have a good
partner in marriage and have many children (No.
23).</p>

<p class='c000'>If the line of the Heart (or the line of Fortune
in India) (No. 25), extend only to the mount of
Apollo (the Sun), the person will scarcely live ten
years. And should this line be broken in many
places the person will die by drowning. But if
another smaller line appear running parallel with
the Heart line and which extends only to the mount
of Apollo (No. 26), the person will meet his death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>either by a fall from a house or a tree. Should,
however, this line extend from the outside part of
the hand to the mount of Jupiter, the life will be
long and good, if not broken.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a line rises from the mount of Venus to the first
phalanx of the thumb he will be a commander of
a large army (No. 27).</p>

<p class='c000'>A vertical line on the mount of Jupiter, the possessor
will be a great diplomatist, but an irreligious
person (No. 28). If this line appear on the mount
of Saturn, he will be a prosperous man with a
beautiful wife and have many children (No. 29).</p>

<p class='c000'>A line under the Sun denotes a trades person
with a long life, but only rises to the middle class
(No. 30).</p>

<p class='c000'>If a vertical and well-defined line appear on the
mount of Mercury (No. 31), the person is likely to
lead a long life in a foreign country.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the line of the Heart (Fortune line) goes to
the mount of Saturn, he will live thirty years.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Life line and the Liver line (called the
Head line in England) be separated entirely, the
female will either be seduced before marriage or
have illegitimate children, or in both sexes be
illegitimate themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the palm of the hand be filled with numerous
and indistinct marks or lines the person leads a
very unhappy life.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a person have single lines or marks thus ==
between the phalanges on the joints of the fingers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and when counted together make twelve, they will
be happy, prosperous and rich for the most part of
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make thirteen he will be very unhappy.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make fifteen he will be dishonest or a
thief.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make sixteen he will be a great gambler
and cheat.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make seventeen he will be guilty of debauchery
and much wickedness.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make eighteen the person will be very
fortunate and religious.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make nineteen he will be very clever and
respectable.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make twenty an enthusiast in religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they make twenty-one he will be a great poet
and become famous.</p>

<p class='c000'>When these lines are joined at the ends and form
the shape of a barleycorn or wheat, the fame and
learning of the person depend on the number; one
would be weak, two strong, and so on. If the lines
just over the mounts be united at the ends, as
described above, the person in whose hands the
same appear will have riches and wealth, but generally
by marriage. If they be united over all four
fingers the person will be very rich, over three less
wealthy and so on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Small concentric circles, formed principally by
the pores of the skin, on the points or first phalanges
of the fingers and thumb, and these be not broken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and appear the same on all four fingers and thumb,
the person will be extremely famous and very
powerful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also on the outer ridge of the hand will be found
various marks.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the marks above the Heart line indicate the
number of wives, and all below the number of
children, the short one indicates those that will
probably die.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line around the lower joint of the thumb
just above the mount of Venus, if well-defined and
clear, and particularly if they bend thus ‿ on the
mount, denote the person to be famous as a sculptor
or painter.</p>

<p class='c000'>If on the mounts of Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo,
Mercury, there be found concentric circles, and
very complete, and in no way broken, the man will
attain great wealth and power through marriage or
marry some noted person.</p>

<p class='c000'>If at the end of the Hepatica or Liver line there
so be an opening like the tail of a fish, the person will
have great happiness and riches.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Lines.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>(1) The line of Life, which ought to be called
the line of the Heart, embraces the root of the
thumb.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The Liver or natural mean runs straight
through the middle of the hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The line of the Head or Brain rises before

begins under the root of the little finger and extends
towards the forefinger.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The Bracelet lines at the root of the hand,
stretch across the wrist, and may be single, double
or treble, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>(6) The Sun line, called for clearness Via Solis,
is a right line which begins at the mount of Apollo
and stretches into the hollow of the hand after
curving towards the mount of the Moon.</p>

<p class='c000'>(7) The line of the Moon, called the Via Lactea,
runs upwards from the line of Saturn, through the
mount of the Moon.</p>

<p class='c000'>(8) The line of Fortune or Saturn begins at the
wrist lines, extends through the hollow of the hand
to the mount of the middle finger. If this line be
cut or severed it is called the Via Combusta; when
this line assumes a double line in the middle of the
palm it is said that you do more good to others than
yourself.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Mounts.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>These are the fleshy or prominent parts under
the fingers, called:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) The mount of Venus, in the root of the thumb.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The mount of Jupiter, in the root of the forefinger.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The mount of Saturn, in the root of the middle
finger.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>(4) The mount of Sun (Apollo), in the root of
the ring finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The mount of Mercury, in the root of the
little finger.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Line of Life.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line, broad, uniform, lively colour and a
good length, denotes the party to be long lived and
subject to few diseases. This line slender, short,
cut or broken, or with obscure little lines, or pale,
or blackish colour, denotes feebleness of body,
sickness, short life. This line sloping nicely to the
Liver line and forming a nice angle with parallel
or little crosses at the juncture, shows good wit and
even temper, a sharp quick person and business
man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Little branches in the upper part branching
towards the Liver line signify riches and honour.
These little lines running the opposite way towards
the wrist denote poverty, deceit, unfaithful servants.
Little confused hair lines in this line signify diseases.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Time of Events.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Should they be found in the lower part of the
hand the good or bad will be in early age. In the
middle of the hand towards the hollow, in the
middle age. If towards the Liver line, in declining
age.</p>

<p class='c000'>Danger of death is threatened if this line be
broken.</p>

<p>PLATE IV.—THE LINE OF LIFE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>To find the exact age this line may be divided
into seventy parts, each part counting one year of
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character ☉ in this line shows loss of an
eye. This character double denotes the loss of
both eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>A line ascending from the line of Life (beneath
the angle formed by the line of Life and the Liver
line) to the line of Saturn, denotes an envious
man, and shows also a perilous disease in that part
wherein it touches the vital. So much the worse
if it cut the line of Life or severs the mount.</p>

<p class='c000'>A line passing from the line of Life to the ring
finger promises honours to follow by means of a
lady of rank, or gain through favour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line of Life thicker than ordinary at the end
under the forefinger shows a laborious old age.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Liver Line.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line being straight and not dissected by
obscure little lines, denotes a healthy body.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it be short or broken and does not reach beyond
the hollow of the hand, it denotes diseases
and a short life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The longer this line, the greater may the life be
warranted.</p>

<p class='c000'>If cut at the end by a small intervening line, it
threatens poverty in old age.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this line is very close to the line of Life, it
denotes diseases of the heart, as palpitation, syncope,
etc.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>If the space between the line of Life and the
Liver line, especially of the space between the
Liver line and the line of Fortune, be broad, it
shows prodigality.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Liver line turn and wind several ways, unequal,
of a different colour and dissected, it bodes
disease or obstruction in the liver, and hence the
disease arising from its weakness. It also denotes
covetousness and depravity of nature and wit;
more especially if from under the region of the
middle finger it extends towards the line of Life,
thus making a short or narrow triangle. Where it
is well drawn and of a good clear colour, it is a sign
of a cheerful and ingenious disposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this line have a sister line it promises inheritances.</p>

<p class='c000'>If continued with some little hard knots, it forebodes
manslaughter either perpetrated or to be
perpetrated, according to the number of those knots.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a cross be found therein, under the region of
the middle finger, it promises death at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it ends with a fork towards the mount of the
Moon, it is a sign of hypocrisy and evil manners.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it bends towards the Mensal it is a token
of a slanderous tongue and envy.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it projects a remarkable branch through
the line of Life unto the mount of Venus, and cuts
or touches the line of Mars, especially if the line
be of a ruddy colour, it warns to be guarded against
thieves and intimates, fraud and deceit of enemies.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>This same branch shows also great heat of the
liver, coming from Mars, whereby life is endangered.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Line of the Head and Brain.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>If this line (ascending from its place with uniform
proportion) connect the line of the Liver and
Life in a triangular form, having a lively colour
and not intersected, it declares a person of admirable
prudence, and of a manly wit and fair fortune.
The more perfect this triangle, the better shall the
temper, wit and courage be. But if it be obtuse, it
argues an evil disposed nature and a rude man. If
there be no triangle, much worse, a fool, a prodigal
and a liar, and frequently a short life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nearer it approaches a right angle, and not
acute, the better the person. But when the angle
formed be very acute, especially when the lines of
Liver and Life touch under the region of the middle
finger, it argues covetousness. If not under the
middle finger, it shows a keen, sharp and powerful
wit, also a clever business person.</p>

<p class='c000'>The left angle (male hand), if it be made upon
the natural mean in the mount of the Moon, and
be a right angle by the line passing to the mount
of Mercury, confirms goodness, and quality of the
intellect.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the line of the Head and Brain throws out
unequal and incomposed branches towards the
mount of the Moon, thereby making unusual characters,
it denotes in men weakness of brain and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>dangerous sea voyages; but in a woman frequent
sorrows of mind and difficulties in child-bearing.
Equal lines thus projected presage the contrary in
both sexes, viz., in men, a clear and well-composed
brain and frequent voyages, and in women cheerfulness
and felicity in child-bearing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line of the Head has this peculiarity; if it
project a cleft or a manifest star upwards to the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavea martis</span>, it signifies boldness and courage; but
if it let fall the same downwards, thefts and deceitfulness.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the line of the Head is joined to the line
of the Dragon's Head it promises a prudent and
pleasant old age. The same throwing a branch in
the shape of a fork towards the place of the line of
Fortune signifies subtlety in managing affairs and
craftiness either to do good or evil.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this character ⊕ appears in or near the fork it
gives riches and honours by means of ingenuity
and arts.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Line of Fortune.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line is also called the Table line. This line,
when it is long enough and without incisures, argues
a due strength in the principal members of man
and denotes constancy. Judge the contrary if this
line be short or crooked or is severed. When this
line terminates under the mount of Saturn, it shows
a vain and lying fellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it projects small branches unto the mount of
Jupiter, it produces honours. Should this be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>simple line on the mount of Jupiter, and void of
any good marks or branches, it is a sign of poverty
and want.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it severs the mount of Jupiter, cruelty of mind
and excessive wrath.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it throws a branch between the forefinger and
the middle, it threatens to a man a wound in the
head, but to a woman danger in child-bearing.</p>

<p class='c000'>A small line running from the line of Fortune to
the space between the middle and ring finger,
denotes sorrow and labour.</p>

<p class='c000'>A line passing from the Liver line to the line of
Fortune, forming an acute angle, brings sorrow
and labour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should there be no Liver line and the line of
Fortune connected by a small line to the line of
Life, it threatens a deadly wound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The absence of the line of Fortune shows a
malevolent, contentious, faithless, inconstant person
and of base conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Confused little lines in the line of Fortune denote
sickness, and if under Mercury, in the first age;
under the mount of the Sun in manhood; under
the middle finger in old age.</p>

<p class='c000'>When certain points are observed in this line
they argue lust and vigour of body.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Bracelets Line.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>If this be double or treble and forming a right
and continuous tract, it promises a good composure
of body.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The line which is nearest to the thumb, of a
good lively colour, and unbroken, promises riches.
Should this line be broken in the middle, crooked
and very pale, it denotes debility of body and a
want of all things.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cross or star placed here shows tranquillity of
life in old age.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there be a star single or double or any lines
near the mount of the thumb, in women they
denote misfortune and infamy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A line passing from the Dragon line through the
mount of Venus, presages adversities either by
means of some kindred or a wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>A line running from the Dragon line to the mount
of the Moon shows adversities and private enemies;
crooked or distorted it increases the evil and shows
long servitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>This line being clear and straight and extending
as far as the region of the Moon, presages many
journeys both by land and sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this line continues to the mount of Mercury it
argues that the man will live in a foreign country
in great esteem. If it extends to the Liver line it
shows an honest behaviour and a long life. If to
the mount of the Sun, single or double, it denotes
great good and enables the man to govern and rule
in great affairs. If it pass to the mount of Mercury
it betokens a man fit for many things. If it does
not extend to the mount of Mercury, but is broken
about the middle and ends beneath that mount, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>denotes an untruthful, tittle-tattling, discontented
person.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this line ascends directly to the mount of
Saturn, it denotes a good position of Saturn in the
geniture; but if crooked and passes towards the
Dragon line and the Liver line, it denotes a hard,
covetous, and laborious man.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Via Solis.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line being straight and uniformly composed
and well coloured, promises the favour of great men,
and joyful honours; if dissected and uneven, judge
the contrary, with various impediments and envy.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Via Lactea.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line being uniformly composed, proportionate
and continued, denotes fortunate journeys both
by sea and land; also a good brain, the favour of
women (the mount of Venus being unafflicted), a
composed and graceful speech. If it be cut or distorted
it argues infelicity and lies; but if whole,
ascending towards the little finger, it is a sign of
great happiness.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Line of Saturn.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line being fully and wholly protracted to
the middle finger is an argument of profound meditations,
and of fortunate events in counsels and
actions.</p>

<p class='c000'>This line deficient is an evil sign portending
many misfortunes, unless other positions favour it.
If bending backward, into the hollow of the hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>towards the mount of the Moon, after the form of
a semicircle, threatens imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line beginning from the line of Life and
passing through the Liver line, to the mount of
Saturn—and if there it touch the Saturnia—threatens
imprisonment.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Morality. The Girdle of Venus.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line of itself, unless there be other testimony
to counteract it, is sufficient to indicate fulness of
nature to appreciate the opposite sex, while the
want of it denotes (except in a measure given by
the fulness of the mount of Venus, etc.) coldness,
unnaturalness for the other sex, and usually a cold,
insipid partner, a poor, neglectful mother or father.
But if this line have a sister line, that is, a small
line running parallel with the Girdle, it argues intemperance
and lust in both sexes and baseness in
sexual matters—a filthy person. If this line be
divided or broken up by various lines it denotes
losses and infamy by reason of these lusts.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Line of Mars. Courage and Fortitude.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>This line is sometimes called the sister line to
the line of Life because it is often found running
parallel with that line and denotes increased vital
force—courage, because it strengthens the heart
and thus the energy. When clear and well-defined
it presages a long and active life, with little or no
diseases. People with this line will suffer largely
from gout, rheumatism and apoplexy if they take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>stimulants of any kind, inasmuch as the person
will have sufficient energy of himself, and all
stimulation which will increase the vascular action
will only impede and retard the heart's action, like
too much oil to a machine. This line strengthens
all things denoted by the line of Life, and if clear
and decidedly red it promises great success in war.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Rule to Tell the Planets.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>When a figure similar to that used by astronomers
in designating the planets is found on the
mount particularly set aside for that planet, as on
the mount of Jupiter there is the figure ♃, and on
the mount of Saturn there is the sign ♄, on Apollo
the sign ☉, on the mount of Mercury there is the
sign ☿, and on the thick part of the thumb you
find a similar sign ♀, on the mount of the moon
the sign ☽, on Mars' place the figure ♂, and so on,
then they are termed benevolent. How far, however,
this is relevant to the subject I do not state,
but I should rather advise the student to treat this
with great care, although the marks given underneath
will be found of value when placed as indicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The planets are considered unfortunate when
confused lines, broken semicircle, gridiron marks,
or signs contrary to the mounts indicated above,
as ♃ to mount of Jupiter, and so on, are found on
the mounts or places.</p>

<p class='c000'>Venus (♀) is dignified when you find on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>mount a clear star, or red furrows running transversely
parallel.</p>

<p class='c000'>A jovial, merry nature is shown by fulness or
elevation of the root of the thumb, but luxurious,
amorous, graceful, comely, concupiscent, very
honest, just and constant in friendship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Description when strong and full: the body
somewhat tall, skin clear, eyes pleasant and sparkling,
full of allurement and temptation. The hair
is brown, light, crisp and soft, sometimes slightly
waving in front or curling; a noble mind. The
mind is ofttimes prone to boasting, and loves the
society of ladies; an admirer of music, painting
and beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professions must be judged according to the
strength or debility of the mount; it produces
musicians, merchants for fancy goods, teachers,
apothecaries, gardeners, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mount weak, not elevated or badly marked,
causes men to be inconstant, lascivious, vain. A
cross near first joint of the thumb signifies an
adulterer, or has had or will have a mishap through
females.</p>

<p class='c000'>The place of Venus, void of incisures, flat and
smooth-looking, shows an effeminate, rude and
sorrowful person, or one foolishly and ridiculously
addicted to merriment and jesting.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Planet Mars. Courage, War.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Mars is fortunate (1) when line of Life is strong,
deep, red and decently drawn; (2) when a cross or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>star is found on his place, especially the palm of
the hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Description when strong: denotes full courage,
often bold, dauntless, stout, warlike, contentious,
firm of purpose, large and lusty appetite, imperious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hair light brown or sandy, yellow, often red.</p>

<p class='c000'>The eyes, blue or grey-green, which often grow
red and terrible-looking when angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mars unfortunate: men, etc., are quarrelsome,
violent, deceitful, angry natures—produces thieves
and murderers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Profession according to strength: generals, surgeons,
ironmasters or workers and tradesmen of all
kinds who work with metal, as ironmongers, farriers,
etc.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em>—Mars has signification of wives, husbands,
sons and friends (deceitful or otherwise).</p>

<p class='c000'>Diseases: he produces fevers, blisters, sore eyes,
skin diseases, apoplexy, wounds, wicked thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Jupiter he affects the gall, the reins, back
and liver.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Venus he affects the privy parts and sexual
diseases.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Mars be strong females have largely constructed
bodies and love men of rank; if Venus be strong
men love women of rank; if weak they form attachments
for servants, coachmen and inferiors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sign ♄ placed in cavea of the hand threatens
a fall from a precipice or some high place; a fall
is also indicated by the line of Saturn stopping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>or breaking on the mount of Mars (hollow of
hand).</p>

<p class='c000'>Imprisonment: a crooked line ascending from
mount of Mars to the mount of Saturn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Journeys and peregrinations denoted by a line
running from plain of Mars (hollow of hand) down
to the Bracelet lines and ending immediately below
the mount of the Moon.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Mount of Jupiter. Honour, Fame, Renown, Ecclesiastical, State, Law.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>The planet is fortunate when (1) a star or double
cross; (2) parallel lines or (3) line clearly drawn
from line of Life to his mount.</p>

<p class='c000'>Description when fortunate: he signifies a noble,
glorious, honest, benevolent, affable, honourable,
merry, renowned, neat, just and equitable person;
good-looking, formidable and happy, with beautiful
hazel or blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hair dark brown; grave gesture, modest, and

gristles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jupiter unfortunate when half a gridiron on his

When generally unfortunate: when flat, flabby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>with no good marks on it, interlaced with a lot of
little hair lines, etc., he causes persons to lose their
estates and brings about great calamities in money
matters, although, if nothing else stops it, the
person will usually recover it after he becomes
strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Diseases: when afflicted he causes troubles of
the heart, cramps, inflammation of the lungs, windy
spasms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Apoplexy indicated by a line transversely cutting
his mount and extending towards the mount

ingenious, honoured, high-minded, wise, humane,
religious, just, moderate, aged, and do all things
wisely.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gives a well-set body with yellow or sandy

sandy. The eyes are sunken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trades, etc.: they are fortunate in agriculture,
in minerals of all kinds, as mines, etc. They are
somewhat careless of their wives and less addicted
to sexual excesses, are more grasping and tenacious
than is just.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Saturn is unfortunate he makes persons
sorrowful, laborious, sordid, humble, covetous, unfaithful,
liars, unfortunate, malicious, oppressed
with continual griefs and calamities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Diseases: he gives dangerous diseases, colds,
coughs, melancholy, hypochondriacal complaints,
dropsy, gout, falling sickness, quartan and hectic
fevers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Accidents: he produces falls from houses, imprisonment
and danger of drowning.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deep line running from the space between the
forefinger and middle finger to the line of Fortune
and cutting or interrupting it, signifies a wound or
disease in the lower part of the abdomen.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Planet Mercury. The Mount of Mercury. Study, Research, Sciences, Speaking, etc.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>When this planet is fortunate, men are ingenious,
studious, scientific and searchers after secrets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professions, trades, etc., according to his dignity:
he produces orators, poets, eloquent speakers, persons
ready to learn anything, mathematicians, merchants,
sometimes crafty, variable people.</p>

<p class='c000'>When unfortunate he produces persons full of
levity, liars, prattlers, thieves, cheats, inconstant,
faithless, traitors, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Diseases: he produces madness, fury, acute
fevers, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Signs of deceit and danger to life: the mensa
sharpened by the concourse of the line of Fortune
and the line of Life or the Liver line. The best
sign is the mensa diverging, open at both ends and
forming the figure ≍.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perfection of wit and science: a star placed (or
other clearly-formed flowers or flag) in the mensa
especially under the mount of Mercury or the Sun.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Mensa. The Part of Fortune.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When fortunate: liberal, magnanimous and long-lived
people. The space between the line of Fortune
and the Liver line (called sometimes the
line of the Heart and the line of the Head), and
forms a nice figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>When unfortunate: small and narrow (by the
approaching of these two lines), it argues slender
fortune, niggardliness and fearfulness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Honours and dignities to follow by great and
noble personages, when a star or cross appears in
this space, clear and well-formed, especially under
the mount of the Sun (see chapter on figures and
flowers on hand).</p>

<p class='c000'>The sign of ♃ here promises prominent ecclesiastical
dignities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Good fortune is denoted by the star or triple
cross. Good and equal lines in this space denote
a good fortune; evil or unequal lines the reverse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The worst sign when no mensa is found, for it
shows obscurity both of life and fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>Misfortune and loss of honours when confused
little lines appear here, the good is diverted, and
anxieties and troubles threaten, to honours especially,
if under the mount of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunate journeys: a cross or star on the
outermost part of the mensa on or near the mount
of the Moon is a sure sign.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Fingers. The Thumb.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Riches and honours shown by overthwart lines
clear and red underneath the nail and joint of the
thumb.</p>

<p class='c000'>A violent death or danger through a married
woman, etc.: a line passing from the upper joint of
the thumb to the line of Life.</p>

<p class='c000'>A contentious nature: confused lines on the
lower joint of the thumb; one always brawling and
scolding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Death by hanging, etc.: a line surrounding the
thumb at the middle joint.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riches and possessions—to be worked for: equal
furrows under the lower joint.</p>

<p class='c000'>Idleness and lack of energy: if the first and
second joints are void of incisures.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Forefinger or Index Finger.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Inheritance: denoted by many overthwart lines
in the top joint; these in the second joint show
envious and evil-disposed persons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Issue, bad tongue: right lines running between
the top and second joints declare in a woman
a numerous issue; in a man bitterness of
tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>A jovial disposition: right lines in the joint
near the mount of Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unchaste and lascivious: in a female hand a
star being placed in the joint near the mount of
Jupiter.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Middle Finger.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An unhappy, melancholy and depraved mind:
denoted by small gridirons or confused marks in
the joints of this finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Success with metals: manifested by equal lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Drowning or violent death: this is denoted by
a star in the joints of this finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Folly and madness: a crossed line, extending
from the root of this finger upwards through the
whole length of the finger.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Ring Finger.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Great and noble fame denoted by a line ascending
unbroken from the mount of the Sun through
the joints of this finger to the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Honour and riches: this is shown by equal lines
in the first joint (near the mount).</p>

<p class='c000'>Enmity of great men: denoted by overthwart
lines here; it is made late in life when these lines
are intersected.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Little Finger.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>The planet Mars has dominion over this finger.
A strong and valorous person when strong and
well fed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em>—From the joints of this finger as from
the mount itself are judgments passed concerning
merchandise and favours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ingenuity and eloquence: a star in the first
joint (near the mount of Mercury) shows this; it
is also shown by a right line extending from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>mount of Mercury to the end of finger, also a
great speaker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Foolishness, etc.: denoted by obtuse and confused
marks placed here.</p>

<p class='c000'>A thief and deceitful person: this is shown by
confused and unfortunate marks appearing in the
first and second joints of this finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perpetual inconstancy: this is shown by adverse
lines in the last or top joint of the finger.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em>—The number of wives and husbands are
frequently indicated from the small lines passing
from the outermost part of the hand to the mount
of Mercury, but I consider the proper place is from
the mount of Venus.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the end of the little finger does not reach so
far as to touch the last joint of the ring finger, it
signifies that the partner in marriage will be imperious
in all things.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mounts marked with good figures and characters
show good and happy omens, being vitiated
with confused or broken characters, etc., or lines,
they always denote the contrary, unless they are
restrained by other lines that be good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chiromancers generally teach that the first joints
near the mount of the finger indicate the early age,
the second, the flourishing state of manhood, and
the last old age. But our opinion is that the planets
shown by the nativity of the persons do, in their
proper order, manifest their marks and characters
whether for good or bad.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Signs on the Head. How to Read the Forehead.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>If a person has a broad forehead and takes the
form of ⌒, a crescent, he was born of poor
parents but is sure to be rich.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a prominent single vein or mark extends from
the nose to the top of the forehead the person is
born to immense wealth.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there are many similarly placed the person is
very vicious.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the forehead is depressed in the middle he is
very jealous and a lascivious or sinful man.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the forehead is narrow he is a great miser.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there be three furrows going across the head
he is likely to live a long life, especially if they go
over the eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there be four such lines the person will be a
commander or great potentate and live a very long
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many indistinct lines on the forehead denote
lewd persons.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there be any marks in the middle of the forehead
and they take the form of a crescent ⌒, the
person will be very prosperous and fortunate.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Signs on the Feet.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>If a crescent or elongated horseshoe mark appear
on sole of the foot and the toes separated well from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>each other, the person will have a harsh temper and
remain poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a female's toes are well set together and close,
and has a wheel or flower mark on either or both
feet, she will become a lady of rank and position.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there be an ear-shaped figure on the foot and
without hair, or a little tuft, the person may expect
to be successful in the world.</p>

<h3 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Arms.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>If her arms are very long she will be renowned
and well-to-do. Short-armed persons generally
remain poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of these excellent essays we cannot speak too highly; they will
prove a new revelation to our scientifically inclined readers and
demonstrate conclusively the impregnable basis of ancient Aryan
Science, which did not neglect the PSYCHIC and MENTAL DATA
which the modern scientific world MUST acknowledge ere long,
and so enter upon an entire 'Reformation' of its methods and
hypotheses. The whole science of the Tatwas is founded on that
which is termed 'Vibration' or 'Motion' and opens up possibilities
which readers of 'THE SECRET DOCTRINE' alone at present
can foresee."—<em>Lucifer.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>"It is beyond question that the unknown writer of this work was
both a scholar and a mystic. That he had studied the <cite>Râmâyana</cite> from
the original texts and was a master of Vedântic psychology is amply
manifested; that he was a mystic himself and spoke of things that
were realities to him and not mere empty speculations, is evident to
every earnest student of Indian theosophical literature. In no other
western publication have the three 'states' of man's consciousness
been so strikingly and so intelligibly set forth as by our author. In
this work the mystic and student of yoga will recognise many a home
truth but slightly veiled, and many an important secret wholly
disclosed."</p>

of in this most excellent book. The essay upon Yoga, the Kingly
Science of the Soul whereby a man may attain to that Divine Wisdom
which is his birthright, deserves to be read of all men. To lovers of
the Scriptures of the World the essay on 'Symbolism' will appeal
strongly and will be found most helpful, for in those Ancient Writings
the most important truths are frequently veiled from the superficial
reader by an allegory or a symbol, and in this essay the reader will
find a clue to the method by which the study of symbols may be
approached with beneficial results. Considerable light is thrown
upon some of the very complex symbols pertaining to Indian
Philosophies."</p>

misinterpretations of sectarians, a Truth, divine and living, may be
found: to them the following pages will bring, if not the full radiance
of Christ's illuminating Love, at least many valuable suggestions for
thought, and aids in the solution of difficult problems. That Christianity,
the religion which the West has made peculiarly its own, should be
reverentially taught by 'an Indian' from an Indian point of view,
is in itself unusual, may be regarded as a happy omen of the ultimate
breaking down of those barriers of Sectarianism which have hitherto
been potent in dividing the English people from sympathetic communion
with the natives of India."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
